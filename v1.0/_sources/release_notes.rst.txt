Summary
===========

This is first production release of the Xilinx Video SDK, a complete solution for high-density real-time transcoding supporting:

- Seamless integration with FFmpeg

- Simultaneous decoding, scaling and encoding of up to 46 streams with a maximum aggregated bandwidth of two 3840x2160\@60 fps per card

- Video resolutions from 128x128 to 3840x2160

For a complete list of features and performance tables, refer to the :doc:`Specs and Features </introduction>` page of the documentation

Limitations
===========

- The scaler is tuned for downscaling and expects non-increasing resolutions in an ABR ladder. Increasing resolutions between outputs will reduce video quality. For more details see :ref:`Setting up an ABR Ladder <setting-up-an-abr-ladder>`.

- The current Alveo U30 solution is targeted for live video real-time transcoding. Even though a single Alveo U30 card has the capability of running two Ultra HD (4K) transcodes in real-time at 60 frames per second (2x4kp60), running a single 4k stream at 120 fps is not supported. Similarly, a single Alveo U30 card supports up to 8x1080p60 transcodes in real-time, but it does not support fewer streams running at 120fps or beyond.

- When processing 4x 1080p60 streams, the scaler can only sustain a rate of 60fps for up to 5 outputs. Therefore, given 4 1080p60 input streams, real-time performance is only possible for up to 20 scaled outputs.

- The maximum bit-rate tested is 35 Mb/s; if the bit-rate is higher, the encoder might not work properly.

- ABR video transcode use cases have been tested with up to 5 output renditions per input for a maximum supported number of channels of 8 running real-time per card. 

- The lookahead feature is not supported when encoding streams to a 4k resolution.

Known Issues
============


Multiple ``Staring new cluster`` messages when encoding to Matroska
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When encoding to .mkv, FFmpeg may have issues synchronizing video and audio data leading to messages of the form::

    [matroska @ 0x563b3f675100] Starting new cluster

- Solution: Pass ``-max_interleave_delta 0`` on the FFmpeg command line


Streams with rotation metadata may cause a segfault while transcoding
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hardware transcode pipeline can be unstable on a stream with rotation metadata

- Solution: Use the ``-noautorotate`` option in cases where rotation metadata is present.

  - Change ``ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i $i -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y out.mp4``
  - to ``ffmpeg -noautorotate -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i $i -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y out.mp4``
  

The ``--revert-to-golden`` and ``--factory_reset`` commands may not work by default
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``xbmgmt program --revert-to-golden`` and ``xbmgmt flash --factory_reset`` command expects the golden image of the card to be flashed at a particular memory location. If this is not the case, the command will not work. 

- Solution: Relocate the golden image by following the instructions below.  

.. _flashing-the-golden-image:

#. To reflash the golden image, your system must be already configured with release 0.96.0 or newer. If this is not the case, `contact Xilinx <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues>`_.

#. Set up your environment:: 

    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

#. List the Management BDF of your devices::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt examine

#. For each device, run the following command to flash the golden image to the expected memory location::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbflash.qspi --qspips-flash --input /opt/xilinx/firmware/u30/gen3x4/base/data/BOOT_golden.BIN  --offset 0x6000000 --bar-offset 0x10000 --card <BDF>

#. Once the golden image has been properly relocated, you can revert the card to the golden image by following the :ref:`card recovery instructions <card-recovery>`.
